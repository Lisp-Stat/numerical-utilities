;;; Utilities for testing accuracy of mathematical functions
;;; This does not test the utility functions in num-utils, it is for
;;; testing the accuracy of the functions in special-functions

;;; TEST-FN         - Compare a function against known reference values. Used in unit tests.
;;; COMPARE-FN      - Compare a function against a reference implementation, e.g. Cephes
;;; COMPARE-VECTORS - Compare two vectors of pre-computed values.

;;; The examples given assume the special-functions test data has been
;;; loaded. TEST-UTILITIES was developed in support of that
;;; library. Note that different versions of the test arrays may have
;;; the same name, for example NEAR-0. Check the package you are using
;;; if you duplicate the examples.

;;; TEST-FUN

;;; This is the most commonly used testing function. It takes a vector
;;; (column of the test data array) of expected values, a function to
;;; be tested, and parameters to the function. Often the parameters to
;;; the function are other columns in the same array, as is the case
;;; with Boost test data.

;;; The input function FN is typically a lambda function, taking a row
;;; index followed by parameters for the function. This makes it easy
;;; to rearrange the parameters to suit the function being tested. For
;;; example incomplete-gamma requires keyword arguments, so you can
;;; provide the keys in the lambda function and the gamma function
;;; paramaterization values from the FN-PARAM-COLUMNS.

#| Examples:
To run the Boost Gamma tests using the test values in the
special-functions tests directory:

(test-fn (select factorials t 1) ; expected values are all rows of the 2nd column (0 based indexing)
#'(lambda (i params)
(specfun:gamma (aref (car params) i))) ; extract the parameter(s) from the param columns
(select factorials t 0))		    ; all rows of the 1st column are the parameters to the lambda function

;;; Same principal, using a different test data set
(test-fn (select near-1 t 1)
#'(lambda (i params)
(specfun:gamma (aref (car params) i)))
(select near-1 t 0))
|#

(defun test-fn (expected-column fn &rest fn-param-columns)
  "Test the differences between expected values and the given function"
  (loop
    with max-delta = 0 and worst-case = 0 and count = (length expected-column)
    for i from 0 to (1- count)
    for delta = (num-delta (aref expected-column i) (funcall fn i fn-param-columns))
    when (> delta max-delta) :do (progn (setf max-delta delta)
					(setf worst-case i))
    minimize delta into min
    maximize delta into max
    sum      delta into sum
    sum      (square delta) into sum-of-delta-squares

    finally (return (make-test-results :worst-case worst-case
				       :min-error  min
				       :max-error  max
				       :mean-error (/ sum count)
				       :test-count count
				       :variance0  (/ (- sum-of-delta-squares
							 (/ (square sum)
							    count))
						      count)
				       :variance1  (/ (- sum-of-delta-squares

						      (1- count))
				       :rms        (sqrt (/ sum-of-delta-squares count))))))




;;; COMPARE-FUNCTIONS

;;; Useful if you don't have 'golden' test data and want to test a
;;; function against a high quality implementation like R, Boost or
;;; Cephes.

;;; FN-PARAMS contain x values and function parametrization values, if
;;; any. All columns must be the same length

#| Examples:
The example assumes that special-functions test data for erf is loaded

(compare-fns #'(lambda (i params)
(specfun:erf (aref (car params) i)))
#'(lambda (i params)
(cephes:erf (aref (car params) i)))
(select erf-data t 0))
