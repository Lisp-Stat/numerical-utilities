#| Implementation Notes

[1] From a discussion on the CCL mailing list, this was a message from
Stas Boukarev, one of the SBCL maintainers, when I asked about using
assert like this:

  (assert (and (plusp (length coefficients))
  	       (every (lambda (elt)
  			(typep elt (class-of x)))
  		      coefficients))
	  (coefficients x)
	  "Coefficients and X must be of the same type.")

so that I could declare the variables in the loop for evaluate-polynomial.

"Are you doing it for performance? Any performance gains you get from
declaring your variables in a loop will be destroyed by performing
typep at runtime.
The cost of determining type-of, parsing it and applying typep on it
is going to be very high, especially if it's done on every element of
a sequence.
If you do need to perform that operation, you can do
(defun foo (x sequence)
  (macrolet ((make-test (x types)
              `(etypecase ,x
                  ,@(loop for type in types
                          collect `(,type (lambda (x) (typep x ',type)))))))
    (every (make-test x (double-float single-float fixnum))
                      sequence)))"

Maybe even putting EVERY inside the expansion, to get better inlining.
And handle specialized arrays without going through each element.
